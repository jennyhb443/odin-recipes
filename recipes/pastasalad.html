    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Get a pot of water and boil it</li>
        <li>Put pasta in water once it is boiling and boil that to whatever pasta softness you like</li>
        <li>While that is happening, cut the carrots, onion, and celery up into little chunks (you have to choose how many and how large you want the chunks to be)</li>
        <li>Once the pasta is done, throw it in a bowl with the carrots, onion, and celery</li>
        <li>Put a few spoonfuls of mayonnaise on it (to taste)</li>
    </ol>
